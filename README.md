# Raspberry Pi 1U Server
There are server colocation providers that allow hosting a 1U server for as low as $30/month, but there's a catch: There are restrictions on power usage (1A @ 120v max, for example) because they're expecting small and power-efficient network equipment like firewalls.

This repo is about designing a server that fits within the 1U space and 1A @ 120v power constraint while maximizing computing power, storage, and value.

## Software Setup
You will need to do this for each of the Raspberry Pi's:
1. [Flash an SD card with Raspbian Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) (under "Raspberry Pi OS (other)" in the Raspberry Pi Imager) and enable SSH with:
    1. `cd /Volumes/boot/`
    1. `touch ssh`
1. Insert the SD card into the Pi, power on, and ssh into the Pi with `ssh pi@<ip address>` and the password "raspberry".
1. Update the hostname to correspond to the number on the case:
    1. `sudo raspi-config`
    1. `1 System Options` -> `S4 Hostname` -> Update hostname -> Finish -> Reboot
1. Update the firmware on the Pi to allow booting from USB:
    1. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y`
    1. `sudo rpi-update` (only do this once on each Pi)
1. Disable HDMI to save power: `sudo sed -i -e '$i \/usr/bin/tvservice -o\n' /etc/rc.local`
1. Disable avahi (used for making raspberrypi.local work on a local network):
    1. `sudo systemctl stop avahi-daemon.service`
    1. `sudo systemctl stop avahi-daemon.socket`
    1. `sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon.service`
    1. `sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon.socket`
1. [Disable wifi and bluetooth](https://chrisapproved.com/blog/raspberry-pi-hardening.html#disable-wireless-interfaces):
    1. `sudo bash -c 'echo -e "dtoverlay=pi3-disable-wifi" >> /boot/config.txt'`
    1. `sudo bash -c 'echo -e "dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt" >> /boot/config.txt'`
    1. `sudo reboot`
1. [Add your public key](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) (while disconnected from the pi, with `ssh-copy-id pi@<IP-ADDRESS>`)
1. Make sure the SSD is plugged into one of the blue USB 3 ports.
1. SSH into the Pi again and [Disable password authentication](https://gist.github.com/brpaz/10243211f3f7cd06cc11#file-deploy_user-sh-L14-L17):
    1. `sudo sed -i '/^#*PubkeyAuthentication /c PubkeyAuthentication yes' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    1. `sudo sed -i '/^#*ChallengeResponseAuthentication /c ChallengeResponseAuthentication no' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    1. `sudo sed -i '/^#*PasswordAuthentication /c PasswordAuthentication no' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    1. `sudo sed -i '/^#*UsePAM /c UsePAM no' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
1. Configure the Pi to [prioritize booting from the SSD](https://docs.nextcloudpi.com/en/rpi4-chnage-boot-order/):
    1. `sudo raspi-config`
    1. `6 Advanced Options` -> `A6 Boot Order` -> `B2 USB Boot` -> Finish -> Reboot
    1. If you see an "No EEPROM bin file found" error, you may need to run `sudo -E rpi-eeprom-config --edit` and add `[all] BOOT_ORDER=0xf14`.
1. Repeat the steps above (without `sudo rpi-update`) with the new OS on the SSD. SSH'ing into the new OS on the SSD may require clearing out the line with the corresponding IP in your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file with `ssh-keygen -R <host>`.

## Hardware Setup
1. Remove the hard drive bay dividers and front panel extension cable from the inside of the chassis.

1. Add the stripped side of another wire of the same length with a female header on one side to a COM terminal on the power supply breakout board, then put the female headers onto the pins of one of the LEDs on the front panel. 

    ![wire front panel LED to the atx breakout board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawl/raspberry-pi-1u-server/master/pictures/front_panel_connection.jpg)

1. Apply electrical tape over the unused header pins and terminal blocks to prevent accidental electrical shorts.
1. Connect the Pi's USB C ports to the USB terminal adapters.
1. Plug in the power and flip the power switch to "on".

## Network Setup
1. Get the static IPs, subnet, and gateway from the colocation provider.
1. Edit `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` on each of the Pis and add the networking info from the colocation provider, for example:
    ```
    interface eth0
    static ip_address=192.168.1.191/24
    static routers=192.168.1.1
    static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
    ``` 
1. `sudo reboot`

## Remote Power Management Software
Only do this on the power management Paspberry Pi connected to the relay:
1. `curl -o relay_control.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawl/raspberry-pi-1u-server/main/relay_control.py`
1. Test the script: `python relay_control.py`

You should see the light on the SSD flash off and on for the Pi whose relay's GPIO pin you entered.

## Measuring Amperage
1. Plug the server into the Kill-A-Watt.
1. Press the button on the Kill-A-Watt for "amps".
1. `sudo apt-get install stress`
1. `while true; do vcgencmd measure_clock arm; vcgencmd measure_temp; sleep 10; done& stress -c 4 -t 900s`
1. Restart the server by unplugging and plugging back in. Watch the amperage on start-up.

## Single Points Of Failure
* Switch 
* Relay 
* Power Supply 
* Electrical Short (from loose terminal or pinched wire?)
* The Management Pi Dies (and can't powercycle most of the other Pi's)

## How Many More Pi's Will Fit?

At least 7. (including 1 Pi Zero and a Pi 3b)

## Cloud Comparisons

This is a tough comparison to make because the Pi CPU cores are only 1.5GHz per core.

### AWS 

* T2.micro - [$9.50/month](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/low-cost-burstable-ec2-instances/) for 1GB Ram & 1 CPU @ 2.5 GHz * 20 = **$190/month**
* T2.medium - $38.00/month for 4GB Ram & 2 CPU @ 2.5 GHz * 10 = **$380/month**

The T2 instances have a limited number of CPU credits, which means they can't run at 100% all the time like the Pi can. 

### Digital Ocean
[$20/month](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing) for 4GB Ram & 2 vCPUs @ 2.5 GHz * 10 = **$200/month**
